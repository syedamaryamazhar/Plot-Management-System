# Plot-Management-System
A basic C++ Plot Management System for booking and tracking plots made in my first semester. Admins can add, edit, and update payments; users can view statuses. Data is managed via file handling and stored in a 2D vector. Includes simple admin login and supports up to 100 plots.
